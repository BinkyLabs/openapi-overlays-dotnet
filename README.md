# OpenAPI Overlay Libraries for dotnet

This project provides a .NET implementation of the [OpenAPI Overlay Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/overlay/latest.html), allowing you to dynamically apply overlays (patches) to existing OpenAPI documents (v3.0+), following the official OpenAPI Overlay 1.0.0 specification.

The library enables developers to programmatically apply overlays, validate them, and generate updated OpenAPI documents without relying on third-party tools like Swagger.
